{"id":"tilt_ui-pzu","title":"Build frontend UI for recipe management","description":"Create comprehensive frontend UI for the recipe CRUD system implemented in PR #87 (now merged).\n\n**Backend Capabilities (Already Built):**\n✅ Multi-format recipe import (BeerXML, BeerJSON, Brewfather JSON)\n✅ Full CRUD API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n✅ BeerJSON 2.06 schema support\n✅ Recipe serializer for BeerJSON output\n✅ Database migrations complete\n\n**PR Reference:** https://github.com/machug/brewsignal/pull/87\n\n---\n\n## Frontend Work Required\n\n### 1. Recipe List Page (`/recipes`)\n- [ ] Table/card view of all recipes\n- [ ] Filter/search by name, style\n- [ ] Sort by name, date created\n- [ ] Quick actions: View, Edit, Delete\n- [ ] Import button (multi-format)\n\n### 2. Recipe Detail Page (`/recipes/[id]`)\n- [ ] Display all BeerJSON fields:\n  - Name, style, brewer, batch size\n  - OG, FG, ABV, IBU, color (SRM)\n  - Boil time, efficiency\n  - Carbonation volumes\n- [ ] Show ingredients (fermentables, hops, cultures/yeasts, misc)\n- [ ] Display mash/fermentation/packaging steps\n- [ ] Edit/Delete actions\n- [ ] \"Create Batch from Recipe\" button\n\n### 3. Recipe Import UI\n- [ ] Multi-format file picker (.xml for BeerXML, .json for BeerJSON/Brewfather)\n- [ ] Format detection help text\n- [ ] Import progress/error feedback\n- [ ] Handle array error responses from backend\n\n### 4. Recipe Create/Edit Forms\n- [ ] Basic info: name, style, brewer, batch size\n- [ ] Gravity/alcohol: OG, FG, ABV\n- [ ] Color/bitterness: SRM, IBU\n- [ ] Brewing params: boil time, efficiency, carbonation\n- [ ] Ingredients sections (fermentables, hops, cultures, misc)\n- [ ] Mash/fermentation/packaging steps\n- [ ] Format extensions field (JSON)\n- [ ] Field validation (updateRecipe uses whitelist)\n\n### 5. Integration Points\n- [ ] Update batch create flow to select from recipes\n- [ ] Link recipe detail to associated batches\n- [ ] Handle temperature unit conversion (C/F)\n- [ ] Use existing TailwindCSS styling conventions\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n**API Endpoints Available:**\n- GET /api/recipes - List all recipes\n- GET /api/recipes/{id} - Get recipe details\n- POST /api/recipes - Create recipe\n- PUT /api/recipes/{id} - Update recipe (uses field whitelist)\n- DELETE /api/recipes/{id} - Delete recipe\n- POST /api/recipes/import - Import from file (BeerXML/BeerJSON/Brewfather)\n- GET /api/recipes/{id}/beerjson - Export as BeerJSON\n\n**Frontend API Functions (Already Created):**\n```typescript\n// From frontend/src/lib/api.ts\ncreateRecipe(data: RecipeCreate): Promise\u003cRecipeResponse\u003e\nupdateRecipe(id: number, data: RecipeUpdate): Promise\u003cRecipeResponse\u003e\nimportRecipe(file: File): Promise\u003cRecipeResponse\u003e\n```\n\n**BeerJSON Field Names:**\n- Use `og`, `fg`, `abv` (NOT og_target, fg_target)\n- Use `color_srm`, `batch_size_liters`\n- Cultures table (was yeasts)\n\n**Security:**\n- updateRecipe uses field whitelist (can't update arbitrary fields)\n- Handle both string and array error formats\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Can view list of all recipes\n- [ ] Can import recipe from BeerXML, BeerJSON, or Brewfather JSON\n- [ ] Can view recipe details with all fields\n- [ ] Can create new recipe manually\n- [ ] Can edit existing recipe (respects backend field whitelist)\n- [ ] Can delete recipe\n- [ ] Can create batch from recipe (integration point)\n- [ ] Temperature units respect user preferences (C/F)\n- [ ] Error handling for import failures\n- [ ] Responsive design (mobile-friendly)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-09T10:52:36.617912412+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T11:35:47.274967461+11:00","closed_at":"2025-12-09T11:35:47.274970341+11:00"}
