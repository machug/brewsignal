Traditional saison temperatures (around 80F/27C) bring out citrus and elevated phenols (pepper and clove). The Brett character shifts depending on wort composition, as maltier beers emphasize cherry and stone fruit qualities.\nThis blend integrates beautifully with fruity and tropical hops, with the unique Brett culture keeping hop aromatics crisp and bright for an extended time. For best results use a highly fermentable wort, dry hopping during the tail of active fermentation, and carbonating naturally.",

The Kveiking blend thrives in hot fermentations when big complex ester profiles are desired. A low pitch rate can be used to drive these aromatics even higher but the brewer should ensure this low pitch rate can be combined with a continuously high fermentation temperature. If the temperature drops too low, the corresponding level of attenuation can be low, with high terminal gravities. This blend contains flocculent and non-flocculent yeast strains, therefore the clarity of the final beers produced can be variable.

LalBrew Voss supports a wide range of fermentation temperatures between 25-40Â°C (77-104Â°F) with a very high optimal range of 35-40Â°C (95-104Â°F). Very fast fermentations are achieved within the optimal temperature range with full attenuation typically achieved within 2-3 days.

Sourvisiae allows the brewer to ferment and sour the beer in one simple step, reducing cross-contamination risks, lowering costs, cutting total process time, and allowing brewers to obtain a consistent product. The brewing process is conducted without any modifications; Sourvisiae is pitched just like conventional yeast and ferments in a normal fermentation time. Sourvisiae does not produce other flavor compounds associated with Brettanomyces, Lachancea, or Lactic Acid Bacteria, providing a cleaner and more reproducible souring process, with much shorter fermentation times.",

Sulfur is commonly produced, but will dissipate with conditioning. This strain is very powdery and will remain in suspension for an extended amount of time following attenuation.
